# Testing Evidence History, Part 4

Historical snapshot of `TESTING.md` lines 1528-2095 before the 2026-07-20 documentation split.
It is retained for traceability; a part may continue a long original list item at a sentence boundary.

- `moon -C cairoon test font_face_test.mbt --target native -v`: 10
  black-box tests passed after adding pycairo-compatible raw C-int toy
  slant/weight parsing for `FontFace::toy_raw` and
  `Context::select_font_face_raw`, including `InvalidSlant`/`InvalidWeight`
  error mapping for invalid raw values.
- `moon -C cairoon test region_test.mbt --target native -v`: 8 black-box
  tests passed after adding `Region::xor_rectangle` split-semantics coverage.
- `moon -C cairoon test region_test.mbt region.mbt.md --target native -v`: 12
  tests passed after changing Region boolean operations to return the mutated
  receiver as a cairoon checked-chaining extension over pycairo's `None`.
  This covered region and rectangle operands, explicit returned-receiver
  checks, a chained rectangle-boolean sequence, and executable Region docs.
- `moon -C cairoon info --target native`: regenerated `pkg.generated.mbti`
  after the public Region return-type change.
- `moon -C cairoon test --target native`: 333 tests passed after the Region
  chainable-mutator slice. ASan/LSan was not rerun because this slice changed
  only MoonBit wrappers, docs, and tests, with no C glue, callback, finalizer,
  or retained-owner changes.
- `moon -C cairoon test src/tests/object/core --target native -v`: 3
  black-box tests passed after adding MoonBit `Eq`/`Hash` protocol coverage for
  hashable Cairo external objects, `Path` self-comparison coverage through
  `Compare`, and `Region` equality coverage without `Hash`.
- `moon -C cairoon test region.mbt.md --target native -v`: 3 executable
  Region reference examples passed.
- `moon -C cairoon test src/tests/matrix/core --target native -v`: 5 Matrix
  core tests passed, covering field/component semantics, multiplication,
  rotation, inversion, and invalid-index/invalid-matrix error mapping.
- `moon -C cairoon test src/tests/matrix/property --target native -v`: 4
  Matrix property tests passed, covering deterministic multiplication
  associativity, inverse identity, composed point/distance transforms, and
  distance-vs-point-delta behavior.
- `moon -C cairoon test src/tests/matrix/pycairo --target native -v`: 4
  pycairo `test_matrix.py`-derived fixtures passed, covering equality,
  component access including positive/negative invalid indexes, invert/multiply,
  translate/scale/rotate composition, and identity point/distance transforms.
- `moon -C cairoon test src/matrix.mbt.md --target native -v`: 4 executable
  Matrix reference examples passed.
- `moon -C cairoon test path.mbt.md --target native -v`: 4 executable Path
  reference examples passed.
- `moon -C cairoon test pattern.mbt.md --target native -v`: 7 executable
  Pattern reference examples passed.
- `moon -C cairoon test surface.mbt.md --target native -v`: 6 executable
  Surface reference examples passed, covering image properties, buffer-backed
  data, similar/subsurface constructors, mapped images, PNG/MIME helpers, and
  checked surface errors.
- `moon -C cairoon test context.mbt.md --target native -v`: 8 executable
  Context reference examples passed, covering construction/state, transforms,
  paths, fill/stroke output, clipping, groups, text/glyphs, and checked context
  errors.
- `moon -C cairoon test font.mbt.md --target native -v`: 7 executable Font
  reference examples passed, covering FontOptions state/raw enum
  compatibility/copy/merge, color palettes, toy font faces with raw slant/weight
  parsing, Surface/Context font options, ScaledFont matrices/metrics,
  text-to-glyphs, and checked font errors.
- `moon -C cairoon test backend_surfaces.mbt.md --target native -v`: 8
  executable Backend Surface reference examples passed, covering PDF/PS/SVG
  stream output and writer errors, PDF metadata/outlines, PS DSC, SVG document
  units, recording replay, Tee fanout, script devices/surfaces, and checked
  backend-specific errors.
- `moon -C cairoon test src/tests/api/enums --target native --deny-warn -v`: 5
  black-box tests passed after adding `Rgb16_565`, `Rgb30`, `Rgb96F`,
  `Rgba128F`, negative-width `Format::stride_for_width`, and pycairo enum
  smoke coverage.
- `moon -C cairoon test surface_pdf_test.mbt surface_ps_test.mbt
  surface_svg_test.mbt --target native -v`: 17 black-box tests passed after
  adding extended PDF/PS backend subtype-mismatch checks and SVG
  document-unit getter finished-status coverage.
- `moon -C cairoon test image_data_test.mbt --target native -v`: 9 black-box
  tests passed after fixing retained `ImageData` views to observe base-surface
  `SurfaceFinished` and adding ordinary/buffer-backed/PNG-loaded `get_data`
  after-finish coverage.
- `moon -C cairoon test --target native`: 325 tests passed.
- `moon -C cairoon info --target native`: passed; the latest ImageData
  owner-status fix did not change the public interface.
- Test-only buffer-backed image oracle coverage plus Pure MoonBit Region
  rectangle-XOR and executable Matrix/Surface/Context/Font/Path/Pattern/Region
  documentation coverage were added without rerunning ASan because no C glue or
  finalizer ownership code changed in those slices.
- Pure MoonBit format-stride coverage was added without rerunning ASan because
  no C glue, finalizer, callback trampoline, or retained owner code changed in
  that slice.
- Pure MoonBit ordinary image-surface finished-status coverage was added
  without rerunning ASan because no C glue, finalizer, callback trampoline, or
  retained owner code changed in that slice.
- Pure MoonBit backend surface subtype/lifecycle error-path coverage was added
  without rerunning ASan because no C glue, finalizer, callback trampoline, or
  retained owner code changed in that slice.
- The later ImageData owner-status fix changed C glue in
  `cairoon_image_data.c`; sanitizer validation is recorded below.
- `run-asan.py --repo-root /Users/caimeo/code/pycairo/cairoon --pkg moon.pkg`:
  rerun for the ImageData owner-status fix. The full runner still failed under
  LeakSanitizer on this macOS workspace, with the known
  FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync class and existing raster-source/README
  leak stacks outside the ImageData owner-status path. The ASan-instrumented
  black-box executable was then run directly with leak detection disabled using
  `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0:fast_unwind_on_malloc=0
  ./_build/native/debug/test/cairoon.blackbox_test.exe
  image_data_test.mbt:0-9`; it exited 0, and
  `/tmp/cairoon-image-data-owner-status-blackbox-asan.txt` shows all nine
  `image_data_test.mbt` tests executed without any AddressSanitizer
  invalid-access report.
- Raster-source optional callback-state coverage added release-only C callback
  ownership paths and reran targeted ASan with leak detection disabled for
  `pattern_test.mbt`.
- Pure MoonBit backend MIME support matrix coverage was added without rerunning
  ASan because no C glue, finalizer, callback trampoline, or retained owner
  code changed in that slice.
- Test-only source/mask/raster-source image-oracle helper coverage was added
  without changing the public API or native test count; sanitizer validation
  is recorded below.
- Documentation-only product-decision audit for pycairo `CAPI`, legacy enum
  aliases, and non-implemented FreeType/user-font classes: `moon -C cairoon
  check --target native`, `moon -C cairoon test --target native -v`, and
  `moon -C cairoon info --target native` passed on 2026-07-03.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun on 2026-07-03 for the source/mask offset
  image-oracle C helper slice. The full runner again failed during the known
  macOS FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class while running the
  black-box executable, before Moon could launch the white-box executable. The
  log at `/tmp/cairoon-source-mask-offset-asan.txt` reports
  `89578 byte(s) leaked in 476 allocation(s)`. A grep of that log found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  heap-buffer-overflow, global-buffer-overflow, or double-free entries. The
  ASan-compiled white-box image oracle was therefore run directly with leak
  detection disabled, and exited 0 as recorded above.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun on 2026-07-03 for the raster-source
  image-oracle C helper slice. The full runner again failed during the known
  macOS FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class after running the
  black-box executable and before launching the white-box executable. The log
  at `/tmp/cairoon-raster-source-oracle-asan.txt` reports
  `55231 byte(s) leaked in 406 allocation(s)`. A grep of that log found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  heap-buffer-overflow, global-buffer-overflow, double-free,
  `cairoon_test_raster_source`,
  `CAIROON_TEST_IMAGE_RASTER_SOURCE_PATTERN`,
  `cairoon_test_apply_raster_source_pattern`,
  `cairoon_test_draw_argb32_scene`,
  `cairoon_test_argb32_scene_oracle`, or `image_oracle` entries. The
  ASan-compiled white-box image oracle was then run directly with leak
  detection disabled; it exited 0 and
  `/tmp/cairoon-raster-source-oracle-whitebox-asan.txt` records both
  `image_oracle_wbtest.mbt` tests.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun on 2026-07-03 for the ScaledFont
  text-to-glyph direct C oracle helper slice. The full runner still failed
  during the known macOS FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class
  after the black-box executable ran and before Moon could launch the
  white-box executable. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-scaled-font-text-to-glyphs-oracle-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  heap-buffer-overflow, global-buffer-overflow, double-free,
  `cairoon_test_scaled_font_text_to_glyphs_oracle`,
  `cairoon_test_scaled_font_extents_oracle`, `scaled_font_oracle`, or
  `cairoon_test_create_scaled_font_oracle` entries indicating invalid access.
  Summary: `55957 byte(s) leaked in 414 allocation(s)`. The ASan-instrumented
  white-box executable was then run directly with leak detection disabled using
  `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0:fast_unwind_on_malloc=0`; it exited 0, and
  `/tmp/cairoon-scaled-font-text-to-glyphs-oracle-whitebox-asan.txt` shows the
  `scaled font extents match direct cairo C oracle` and
  `scaled font text_to_glyphs matches direct cairo C oracle` tests executed
  without any AddressSanitizer invalid-access report.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun on 2026-07-03 for the glyph-index width
  FFI slice. The full runner still failed during the known macOS
  FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class after the black-box
  executable ran. A grep of `/tmp/cairoon-glyph-index-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  heap-buffer-overflow, global-buffer-overflow, or double-free entries; the
  `cairoon_context_glyph` hits were leak-stack frames. Summary:
  `1667619 byte(s) leaked in 12429 allocation(s)`. The ASan-instrumented
  black-box executable was then run directly with leak detection disabled for
  `value_types_test.mbt`, `glyph_array_test.mbt`, `text_to_glyphs_test.mbt`,
  `context.mbt.md`, and `README.mbt.md`; it exited 0 and
  `/tmp/cairoon-glyph-index-blackbox-asan.txt` records the selected tests. The
  ASan-instrumented white-box executable was likewise run for
  `scaled_font_oracle_wbtest.mbt` and `image_oracle_wbtest.mbt`; it exited 0
  and `/tmp/cairoon-glyph-index-whitebox-asan.txt` records those oracle tests.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun on 2026-07-03 for the raster-source
  callback allocation stress slice. The full runner still failed during the
  known macOS FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class after the
  black-box executable ran. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-raster-callback-stress-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  heap-buffer-overflow, global-buffer-overflow, double-free, `cairoon_raster`,
  `raster_source`, `cairoon_pattern`, or raster-source helper entries
  indicating invalid access; the `raster_lifetime` hit was the Moon test
  selector line. Summary:
  `55957 byte(s) leaked in 414 allocation(s)`. The ASan-instrumented black-box
  executable was then run directly with leak detection disabled using
  `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0:fast_unwind_on_malloc=0`; it exited 0, and
  `/tmp/cairoon-raster-callback-stress-blackbox-asan.txt` shows the
  `raster source callback allocation stress` test executed without any
  AddressSanitizer invalid-access report.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun on 2026-07-03 for the raster-source
  acquire-only release-trampoline slice. The full runner still failed during
  the known macOS FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class after the
  black-box executable ran. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-raster-release-trampoline-asan.txt` found no
  heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after, heap-buffer-overflow,
  global-buffer-overflow, double-free, `cairoon_raster`, `raster_source`,
  `cairoon_pattern`, or `make_data_backed_raster_source_pattern` entries.
  Summary: `89194 byte(s) leaked in 474 allocation(s)`. The ASan-instrumented
  black-box executable was then run directly with leak detection enabled for
  `pattern_test.mbt:0-17` and `raster_lifetime_stress_test.mbt:0-1`; both
  exited 0 and the logs record the selected tests.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun for the two-page vector oracle helper
  slice. The full runner still failed during the known macOS
  FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class before the white-box
  executable launched. A grep of `/tmp/cairoon-vector-multipage-asan.txt` found
  no `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, heap-buffer-overflow,
  global-buffer-overflow, double-free,
  `cairoon_test_render_vector_scene_oracle`,
  `cairoon_test_draw_vector_scene`, `cairoon_test_render_vector_surface`, or
  `cairoon_test_vector` entries. Summary:
  `56037 byte(s) leaked in 415 allocation(s)`.
  The ASan-instrumented white-box executable was then run directly with leak
  detection disabled using
  `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0:fast_unwind_on_malloc=0`; it exited 0, and
  `/tmp/cairoon-vector-multipage-whitebox-asan.txt` shows the vector output
  oracle test executed without any AddressSanitizer invalid-access report.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun on 2026-07-03 for the image glyph-oracle
  helper slice. The full runner still failed during the known macOS
  FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class before launching the
  white-box executable. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-image-glyph-oracle-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,

  `cairoon_test_argb32_scene_oracle`, `cairoon_test_copy_image_bytes`, or
  `image_oracle` entries. Summary:
  `56037 byte(s) leaked in 415 allocation(s)`.
  The ASan-instrumented white-box executable was then run directly with leak
  detection disabled using
  `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0:fast_unwind_on_malloc=0`; it exited 0, and
  `/tmp/cairoon-image-glyph-oracle-whitebox-asan.txt` shows the image oracle
  test executed without any AddressSanitizer invalid-access report.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun on 2026-07-03 for the external
  value-wrapper stress slice. The full runner still failed during the known
  macOS FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class after the
  black-box executable ran. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-finalizer-value-stress-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,

  entries indicating invalid access; the `lifetime_stress` hit was the Moon
  test selector line. Summary:
  `55717 byte(s) leaked in 412 allocation(s)`. The ASan-instrumented
  black-box executable was then run directly with leak detection disabled; it
  exited 0, and

  `lifetime_stress_test.mbt` tests executed without any AddressSanitizer
  invalid-access report.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun on 2026-07-03 for the `ImageData` view
  allocation stress slice. The full runner still failed during the known macOS
  FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class after the black-box
  executable ran. A grep of `/tmp/cairoon-image-data-stress-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  heap-buffer-overflow, global-buffer-overflow, double-free,
  `cairoon_image_data`, `mapped_image_surface_get_data`, or mapped/image data
  helper entries indicating invalid access; the `lifetime_stress` and
  `image_data_test` hits were Moon test selector lines. Summary:
  `56325 byte(s) leaked in 418 allocation(s)`. The ASan-instrumented black-box
  executable was then run directly with leak detection disabled using
  `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0:fast_unwind_on_malloc=0`; it exited 0, and
  `/tmp/cairoon-image-data-stress-blackbox-asan.txt` shows all five
  `lifetime_stress_test.mbt` tests executed without any AddressSanitizer
  invalid-access report.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: rerun on 2026-07-03 for the backend stream
  callback stress slice. The full runner still failed during the known macOS
  FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer class after the black-box
  executable ran. A grep of `/tmp/cairoon-stream-callback-stress-asan.txt`
  found no `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  heap-buffer-overflow, global-buffer-overflow, double-free, `cairoon_stream`,
  `cairoon_pdf_surface_create_for_stream`,

  `cairoon_script_device_create_for_stream` entries indicating invalid access;
  the `lifetime_stress` hit was the Moon test selector line. Summary:
  `55669 byte(s) leaked in 412 allocation(s)`. The ASan-instrumented black-box
  executable was then run directly with leak detection disabled using
  `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0:fast_unwind_on_malloc=0`; it exited 0, and
  `/tmp/cairoon-stream-callback-stress-blackbox-asan.txt` shows all six
  `lifetime_stress_test.mbt` tests executed without any AddressSanitizer
  invalid-access report.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: ran the 237-test native suite on 2026-07-03
  after the `Surface`/`Context`/`Pattern` pointer equality/hash slice. No
  AddressSanitizer invalid-access report appeared, and a grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-equal-hash-asan.txt` found no
  `cairoon_surface_equal`, `cairoon_surface_hash`, `cairoon_context_equal`,
  `cairoon_context_hash`, `cairoon_pattern_equal`, or
  `cairoon_pattern_hash` entries in visible leak roots. The run still failed
  during the same known macOS FontRegistry/CoreText/ColorSync LeakSanitizer
  class: `56037 byte(s) leaked in 415 allocation(s)`.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: ran on 2026-07-03 after adding retained-owner
  lifetime stress tests. The first run found a real heap-use-after-free when a
  `Surface` returned by `Context::get_target` outlived a context created from a
  `MappedImageSurface`; the borrowed target wrapper did not retain the mapped
  image wrapper, so the mapped image finalizer could unmap the image before
  `Surface::copy_data`. This was fixed by returning borrowed target/group
  target wrappers with the context target wrapper retained as their base. The
  fixed rerun progressed past that invalid access and then failed during
  LeakSanitizer reporting with the known macOS
  FontRegistry/CoreGraphics/CoreText/ColorSync leak roots
  (`91029 byte(s) leaked in 494 allocation(s)`). No AddressSanitizer
  invalid-access report appeared in the fixed rerun before LSan failed.
- ASan/LSan via `run-asan.py`: ran the 108-test native suite after the PNG
  filename API slice, the 113-test native suite after the
  `Surface::image_for_data` slice, and the 114-test native suite after the
  cairo-surface user-data lifetime fix, and the 117-test native suite after the
  portable Surface base API slice, the 122-test native suite after the
  mapped image surface slice, and the 127-test native suite after the Surface
  MIME data slice, and the 131-test native suite after the Context group API
  slice, the 136-test native suite after the Context tag API slice, and the
  142-test native suite after the Context toy text API slice, and the 148-test
  native suite after the glyph array API slice, and the 152-test native suite
  after the text-to-glyphs/show-text-glyphs slice, and the 156-test native
  suite after the RecordingSurface slice, and the 161-test native suite after
  the SVGSurface slice, and the 167-test native suite after the PSSurface
  slice, and the 173-test native suite after the PDFSurface slice; these runs
  failed in LeakSanitizer, as did the 179-test native suite after the
  MeshPattern slice and the 185-test native suite after the
  Device/ScriptSurface slice and the 185-test native suite after the PDF
  outline flag-set slice, then failed after the module-constants slice with the
  expanded 189-test native suite, and after the `create_for_rectangle` slice
  with the expanded 190-test native suite, and after the `set_source_surface`
  slice with the expanded 192-test native suite, and after the
  `Context::set_hairline/get_hairline` slice with the same 192-test native
  suite, and after the retained-parent `create_for_rectangle` lifetime
  hardening with the expanded 193-test native suite, and after the retained-owner
  lifetime stress/fix slice with the expanded 196-test native suite.
  The later status/error classification slice is pure MoonBit test coverage and
  raised the native suite to 198 tests; ASan was not rerun for that non-C change.
  The TeeSurface slice added C glue and raised the native suite to 201 tests;
  ASan/LSan was rerun on 2026-07-03. It reported only the same macOS
  LeakSanitizer class, with no `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`,
  heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after, `cairoon_tee`, or `tee_surface` entries
  in `/tmp/cairoon-tee-asan.txt`; summary:
  `90213 byte(s) leaked in 490 allocation(s)`. The most recent leak report is
  rooted in
  `cairo_toy_font_face_create`, `cairo_select_font_face`, macOS
  FontRegistry/CoreGraphics frames, and scaled-font Quartz/CoreText paths such
  as `cairo_scaled_font_create`, `CGFontCopyURL`, and
  `CTFontCreateWithGraphicsFont`, plus toy-text rendering caches reached
  through `cairo_show_text`, and glyph rendering/path caches reached through
  `cairo_show_glyphs`, `cairo_glyph_path`, and `cairo_show_text_glyphs`,
  `CTFontDrawGlyphs`, CoreGraphics, and ColorSync;
  no AddressSanitizer invalid-access report appeared before LSan failed and no
  text-to-glyphs native result finalizer, glyph/cluster marshaling helper,
  RecordingSurface helper, PDFSurface helper, PSSurface helper, SVGSurface
  helper, PDF outline helper, MeshPattern/Pattern helper,
  Device/ScriptSurface helper, Context text/tag/group, MIME-data stub, or
  compile-time constant helper ownership stack, or Surface
  `create_for_rectangle` helper, retained-parent subsurface helper/finalizer
  stack, retained target/group-target helper stack, mapped-image lifetime
  helper stack, TeeSurface helper stack, or Context
  `set_source_surface`/hairline helpers appeared in the visible leak roots.
  The later `FORMAT_INVALID` constant-sentinel slice touched the C
  compile-time integer-constant oracle and raised the native suite to 202
  tests; ASan/LSan was rerun on 2026-07-03. It reported only the same macOS
  LeakSanitizer class. A grep of `/tmp/cairoon-format-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  `cairoon_compile_int_constant`, `cairoon_compile_string_constant`,
  `cairoon_misc`, or compile-time constant helper stack entries; summary:
  `89925 byte(s) leaked in 482 allocation(s)`.
  The later vector-output marker slice added a private C file-scan test helper
  and raised the native suite to 205 tests; ASan/LSan was rerun on
  2026-07-03. It reported only the same macOS LeakSanitizer class. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-vector-output-asan.txt` found no `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`,
  heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after, global-buffer-overflow, or
  `cairoon_test_file` entries; summary:
  `89925 byte(s) leaked in 482 allocation(s)`.
  The later tag-nesting slice is pure MoonBit test coverage and raised the
  native suite to 206 tests; ASan was not rerun for that non-C change.
  The later direct C image-oracle slice added a private C helper and raised the
  native suite to 207 tests; ASan/LSan was rerun on 2026-07-03. It reported
  only the same macOS LeakSanitizer class. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-image-oracle-asan.txt` found no `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`,
  heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after, global-buffer-overflow, or
  `cairoon_test_argb32` entries; summary:
  `90021 byte(s) leaked in 479 allocation(s)`.
  The later PDF link-tag output marker slice is pure MoonBit test coverage and
  raised the native suite to 208 tests; ASan was not rerun for that non-C
  change.
  The later ImageData mutable-view slice added C glue, a new external object,
  and four black-box tests, raising the native suite to 212 tests. ASan/LSan
  was rerun on 2026-07-03. It reported only the same macOS LeakSanitizer class.
  A grep of `/tmp/cairoon-image-data-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  global-buffer-overflow, `cairoon_image_data`, or
  `cairoon_image_surface_get_data` entries; summary:
  `89173 byte(s) leaked in 474 allocation(s)`.
  The later mapped-image ImageData slice added three black-box tests, raising
  the native suite to 215 tests. ASan/LSan was rerun on 2026-07-03. It reported
  only the same macOS LeakSanitizer class. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-mapped-image-data-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  global-buffer-overflow, `cairoon_image_data`,
  `cairoon_image_surface_get_data`, or
  `cairoon_mapped_image_surface_get_data` entries; summary:
  `64989 byte(s) leaked in 398 allocation(s)`.
  The later PDF/PS/SVG stream-writer slice added C callback state,
  copied-byte trampolines, and four black-box tests, raising the native suite
  to 219 tests. The first ASan/LSan run exposed a real `moonbit_make_bytes`
  leak rooted at `cairoon_stream_write`; after removing the extra retained
  reference, the fixed ASan/LSan rerun reported only the same macOS
  LeakSanitizer class. A grep of `/tmp/cairoon-stream-asan-fixed.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  global-buffer-overflow, or `cairoon_stream` entries; summary:
  `65485 byte(s) leaked in 405 allocation(s)`.
  The later PNG stream-write slice reused the copied-byte writer trampoline and
  added two black-box tests, raising the native suite to 221 tests. ASan/LSan
  was rerun on 2026-07-03 and reported only the same macOS LeakSanitizer class.
  A grep of `/tmp/cairoon-png-stream-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  global-buffer-overflow, `cairoon_surface_write_to_png_stream`, or
  `cairoon_stream` entries; summary:
  `64909 byte(s) leaked in 399 allocation(s)`.
  The later PNG stream-read slice added exact-length reader callbacks and two
  black-box tests, raising the native suite to 223 tests. ASan/LSan was rerun
  on 2026-07-03 and reported only the same macOS LeakSanitizer class. A grep
  of `/tmp/cairoon-png-read-stream-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  global-buffer-overflow, `cairoon_image_surface_create_from_png_stream`,
  `cairoon_stream_read`, or `cairoon_stream` entries; summary:
  `55397 byte(s) leaked in 405 allocation(s)`.
  The later script stream-device slice added device-retained write callbacks
  and two black-box tests, raising the native suite to 225 tests. ASan/LSan was
  rerun on 2026-07-03 and reported only the same macOS LeakSanitizer class. A
  grep of `/tmp/cairoon-script-stream-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  global-buffer-overflow, `cairoon_script_device_create_for_stream`,
  `cairoon_stream_attach_device`, or `cairoon_stream` entries; summary:
  `64765 byte(s) leaked in 396 allocation(s)`.
  The later RasterSourcePattern slice added retained MoonBit acquire/release
  callbacks, acquired-surface owner tracking, a README doctest, two focused
  black-box behavior/lifetime tests, one subtype-mismatch test, and raster
  coverage inside the retained-owner stress loop, raising the native suite to
  229 tests. ASan/LSan was rerun on 2026-07-03 and reported only the same macOS
  LeakSanitizer class. A grep of `/tmp/cairoon-raster-source-asan.txt` found
  no `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  global-buffer-overflow, `cairoon_raster`, `raster_source`, or
  `cairoon_pattern` entries; summary:
  `64333 byte(s) leaked in 390 allocation(s)`.
  The later raster-source get-acquire slice returned retained MoonBit
  acquire/release closures and added two focused tests for callback retrieval,
  optional release callbacks, clear behavior, and subtype mismatch, raising the
  native suite to 231 tests. ASan/LSan was rerun on 2026-07-03 and reported
  only the same macOS LeakSanitizer class. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-raster-get-acquire-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  global-buffer-overflow, `cairoon_raster`, `raster_source`, or
  `cairoon_pattern` entries; summary:
  `55365 byte(s) leaked in 405 allocation(s)`.
  The later vector-output direct C oracle slice added private C helpers for
  direct PDF/PS/SVG paint-fixture generation and normalized file comparison,
  while keeping the native suite at 231 tests. ASan/LSan was rerun on
  2026-07-03 and reported only the same macOS LeakSanitizer class. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-vector-oracle-asan.txt` found no
  `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`, heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after,
  global-buffer-overflow, `cairoon_test_render_vector`,
  `cairoon_test_vector`, `cairoon_test_read_file`,
  `cairoon_test_files_equal`, or `cairoon_test_paint_vector` entries; summary:
  `55365 byte(s) leaked in 405 allocation(s)`.
  The later vector tag inertness slice added two pure MoonBit tests for PS/SVG
  Link tag no-op behavior, raising the native suite to 233 tests. ASan/LSan was
  not rerun for that slice because it did not change C glue or ownership code.
  The later image oracle slices added private C helpers for twenty deterministic
  ARGB32 scenes covering paint, stroke, fill/stroke rectangles, Bezier paths,
  transforms, RGBA compositing, linear/radial gradients, toy-font `text_path`,
  toy-font `show_text`, `glyph_path`, `show_glyphs`, `show_text_glyphs`,
  source-surface offset sampling, mask-surface offset compositing, and
  raster-source pattern repeat rendering, dashed round-cap stroke state,
  clipped paint/fill output, `OperatorClear` compositing output, and a
  surface-pattern `Reflect`/`Nearest`/`DitherBest`/matrix combination, without
  changing the current test count because they broaden one existing white-box
  oracle test. ASan/LSan
  records for the image-oracle C helpers are recorded in the current verified
  block above; the full runner still fails during the
  known macOS LeakSanitizer class before the white-box executable launches, and
  the instrumented white-box executable exits 0 with leak detection disabled.
  The later `ScaledFont::text_to_glyphs_only` slice added pure MoonBit API
  coverage for pycairo's `with_clusters=False` path, keeping the native suite
  at 233 tests; ASan/LSan was not rerun for that non-C change.
  The later ScaledFont text-to-glyph oracle slice added a private C helper and
  a second white-box ScaledFont oracle test, raising the native suite to 249
  tests; ASan/LSan was rerun as recorded above.
  The later ScaledFont text-to-glyph matrix slice expanded that same white-box
  oracle test to cover empty, ASCII, precomposed Latin UTF-8, CJK UTF-8, and
  varied baseline coordinates without changing public API or test count; ASan
  was not rerun because no C glue changed.
  The later vector scene oracle slice broadened the private C vector oracle
  from a paint-only fixture to seven deterministic PDF/PS/SVG scenes covering
  paint, stroke, fill/stroke rectangles, Bezier paths, transforms, and
  linear/radial gradients, raising the native suite to 234 tests. ASan/LSan was
  rerun on 2026-07-03; the full runner still failed during the known macOS
  LeakSanitizer class before the white-box executable launched, with summary
  `55445 byte(s) leaked in 407 allocation(s)`. A grep of
  `/tmp/cairoon-vector-scenes-asan.txt` found no `ERROR: AddressSanitizer`,
  heap-use-after-free, stack-use-after, heap-buffer-overflow,
  global-buffer-overflow, double-free,
  `cairoon_test_render_vector_scene_oracle`,
  `cairoon_test_draw_vector_scene`, or
  `cairoon_test_render_vector_surface` entries. The ASan-instrumented
  white-box executable was then run directly with leak detection disabled and
  exited 0; `/tmp/cairoon-vector-scenes-whitebox-asan.txt` shows the vector
  output scene oracle test executed without any AddressSanitizer invalid-access
  report.
  The later toy-font text-path and `show_text` oracle slices expanded those
  fixtures to nine scenes, and the later two-page oracle slice expanded them to
  ten scenes without changing the number of tests. The latest sanitizer
  validation is recorded in the current verified block above.
  The later Surface invalid-size slice added pure MoonBit black-box coverage for
  `create_similar`, `create_similar_image`, and `create_for_rectangle` mapping
  negative dimensions to `CairoInvalidArgument(InvalidSize, _)`, raising the
  native suite to 251 tests. ASan/LSan was not rerun for that slice because it
  did not change C glue or ownership code.
  The later ScaledFont matrix-composition slice added pure MoonBit black-box
  coverage for sheared font matrices, sheared CTMs, CTM translation suppression,
  and scale-matrix composition, raising the native suite to 252 tests.
  ASan/LSan was not rerun for that slice because it did not change C glue or
  ownership code.
  The later Region documentation slice added `region.mbt.md` with three
  executable examples, raising the native suite to 256 tests. ASan/LSan was not
  rerun for that slice because it did not change C glue or ownership code.
  The later Matrix documentation slice added `matrix.mbt.md` with four
  executable examples, raising the native suite to 260 tests. ASan/LSan was not
  rerun for that slice because it did not change C glue or ownership code.
  The later Matrix property-test slice added `matrix_property_test.mbt` with
  four deterministic property checks for multiplication associativity, inverse
  identity, composed point/distance transforms, and distance-vs-point-delta
  behavior, raising the native suite to 392 tests. The file is included in the
  targeted normal and ASan verification gate because it exercises value-level
  transform semantics used throughout drawing code.
  The later Path documentation slice added `path.mbt.md` with four executable
  examples covering typed segments, pycairo-style string formatting, flattened
  append behavior, copied-path ownership, and checked invalid-matrix errors,
  raising the native suite to 264 tests. ASan/LSan was not rerun for that slice
  because it did not change C glue or ownership code.
  The later Pattern documentation slice added `pattern.mbt.md` with six
  executable examples covering solid/shared state, surface patterns, gradients,
  mesh patches, raster-source callbacks, and checked subtype/index/lifecycle
  errors, raising the native suite to 270 tests. ASan/LSan was not rerun for
  that slice because it did not change C glue or ownership code.
  The later buffer-backed image oracle slice expanded `image_oracle_wbtest.mbt`
  so `Surface::image_for_data` renders the same ARGB32 scenes against the
  existing direct C Cairo oracle and verifies backing-buffer bytes match
  `copy_data`, raising the native suite to 271 tests. ASan/LSan was not rerun
  for that slice because it did not change C glue or ownership code. The later
  source/mask offset oracle slice expanded that image oracle helper to fifteen
  scenes covering non-zero `set_source_surface` and `mask_surface` offsets on
  ordinary and buffer-backed image surfaces. The later raster-source image
  oracle slice expanded it to sixteen scenes by comparing `Pattern::raster_source`
  repeat rendering against direct C Cairo. The later dashed-stroke image oracle
  slice expanded it to seventeen scenes by comparing dash and round-cap stroke
  state against direct C Cairo. The later clipped-output image oracle slice
  expanded it to eighteen scenes by comparing clipped paint/fill output against
  direct C Cairo. The later operator-output image oracle slice expanded it to
  nineteen scenes by comparing `OperatorClear` compositing output against direct
  C Cairo. The later surface-pattern-combo image oracle slice expanded it to
  twenty scenes by comparing surface-pattern
  `Reflect`/`Nearest`/`DitherBest`/matrix combination output against direct C
  Cairo.
  The later Surface documentation slice added `surface.mbt.md` with six
  executable examples covering image properties, buffer-backed data,
  similar/subsurface constructors, mapped images, PNG/MIME helpers, and checked
  surface errors, raising the native suite to 277 tests. ASan/LSan was not
  rerun for that slice because it did not change C glue or ownership code.
